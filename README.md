## Carbon Accounting Demos
### [Demo 01: Cloud-scale Fleet Emissions Estimates via Core AWS Services and AWS Carbon Data Lake](https://github.com/aaronmsoto/sustainability-demos/blob/main/carbon-accounting-demos/demo01-aws-carbon-data-lake/README.md)
#### Status: Published
This demo will use a large public dataset as emissions activity source data and run the data through various processing steps, including through the **AWS Guidance for Carbon Data Lake** to obtain emissions estimates.\

## Other Demos
### ML Demo: Predicting Air Quality w/ ASDI NOAA + OpenAQ Datasets
#### Status: Published and Presented at AWS re:Invent 2022
This demo consists of a Jupyter Notebook that connects to Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative (ASDI) datasets from NOAA and OpenAQ to build a Machine Learning (ML) model to predict air quality levels using weather data via a Binary Classification AutoGluon model.\
